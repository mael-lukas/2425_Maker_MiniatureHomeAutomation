# Miniature Home Automation
#### 2025 Maker Project

## Goals
* Design a miniature home (that could house a small animal for example) using rapid prototyping methods
* Implement wireless control over several parts of the house (doors, food & water dispenser, lights...)
* Implement sensors to monitor the house (temperature, lighting level...)

## Design 
* Wood CNC machine for the house structure
* Details and actuatable parts 3D printed
* Design idea similar to a doll house but with structure adapted to resemble a real home that could house a small animal (hamster, rat)

## Wireless home automation
* Sensors and actuators linked together to a micro-controller than can drive them all
* Main controller on the house or in a wireless portable version sending data via bluetooth module (hc-05) with screen to display sensor readings and button to actuate parts of the house
